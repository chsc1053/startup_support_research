This analysis helps to interpret and classify textual data using different techniques applied in machine learning (ML) models. In this paper, we compared simple and ensemble ML methods as classifiers for SA: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Light GBM, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Bagging. For this, we considered a test set database of 50,000 movie reviews, of which 25,000 were rated positive and 25,000 negatives. We have chosen 20,000 words that have an impact on the feelings of the documents. This work aims to propose a new rating prediction approach based on a textual customer review. We consider term frequency characteristics and term frequency-inverse document frequency from the large-scale and serial trials to compare the results obtained by various classifiers using feature extraction techniques. For the decision phase, we applied the Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score Method, one of the most recent methods for multi-criteria decision-making. To evaluate and quantify the performance of the different ML methods we considered, we apply six standard measures namely precision, accuracy, recall, F-score, AUC, and Kappa-measure. The results we obtained, at the end of the experimental work that we conducted, indicated that the SVM classier is the best with 88,333% as a precision rate followed by the FDOSM method, with 0.800 for the same measurement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Gradient methods; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Decisions makings; Gradient boosting; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Movie reviews; New approaches; Sentiment analysis; Support vectors machine; Text analysis; Word selection; Sentiment analysis,Data science; Decision-making; Machine learning; Movie review; Sentiment analysis; Text analysis; Word selection,,,"M.A. Jassim; Al-Muthanna University, Samawah, Iraq; email: mustafa944@mu.edu.iq",,Springer,18695450,,,,Soc.

Monitoring, however, is expensive, and we lack baseline data for countless species and landscapes around the globe. One solution is to utilize methods that leverage observations collected by everyday people. Humans are not only excellent sensors for diverse data, but possess a remarkable ability to process data and differentiate patterns with minimal training. Here, we explored the potential for people, including guides who work in tourism in southern Patagonia, to determine whether paired photographs of puma (Puma concolor puma) faces were the same individual, akin to a computer-led Siamese network analysis. Overall, participants performed well (average score of 92.2 %) and we detected no differences in local people versus those from the USA, or differences due to differential experience working with pumas. Based on these results, we built a historic capture-recapture dataset of individual pumas collected by local guides and report annual abundance for a portion of the Torres del Paine UNESCO Biosphere in southern Chile, an area lacking such data and of critical conservation for the species. Our results highlight the innate capabilities of human computers and their potential for contributing to wildlife surveys in novel ways to increase science capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Chile; Patagonia; Animals; Face recognition; Tourism; Baseline data; Conservation strategies; Facial recognition; Minimal training; Participatory science; Patagonia; Process data; Puma concolor; Wildlife populations; Wildlife tourism; biosphere; carnivore; collective action; nature conservation; tourism development; tourism economics; UNESCO; wildlife management; Conservation,Facial recognition; Participatory science; Puma concolor; Wildlife tourism,Carroll Petrie Foundation; Regina Bauer Frankenberg Foundation; Summerlee Foundation,This work was supported by the Summerlee Foundation ; the Regina Bauer Frankenberg Foundation ; and the Carroll Petrie Foundation .

Objective: To provide a systematic overview of the literature about interventions designed to empower older people and informal caregivers in transitional care decision-making. Design: A systematic review (Prospero Protocol CRD42020167961; funded by the EU?s Horizon 2020 program). Data sources: Five databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Review methods: The review included evaluations of empowerment in decision-making interventions for older people and informal caregivers facing care transitions, that were published from the inception of the databases up until April 2022. Data extractions were performed by two independent researchers and the quality of studies was assessed with the relevant JBI-critical appraisal tools. A narrative descriptive analysis of the results was performed. Findings: Ten studies, reporting on nine interventions, and including a total of 4642 participants, were included. Interventions included transition preparation tools, support from transition coaches, shared decision-making interventions, and advance care planning. Designs and outcomes assessed were highly diverse and showed a mix of positive and lacking effects. Conclusions: There is a lack of research on how to empower older people and their informal caregivers in transitional care decision-making. Empowerment in decision-making is usually not central in transitional care interventions, and effects on actual empowerment are mostly not assessed. Conclusions on how to empower older people and informal caregivers in transitional care decision-making cannot be drawn. © 2023, The Author(s).","Advance Care Planning; Aged; Caregivers; Databases, Factual; Decision Making, Shared; Humans; Transitional Care; adult; advance care planning; article; caregiver; Cinahl; data extraction; data source; decision making; Embase; empowerment; female; human; human experiment; Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist; male; Medline; narrative; outcome assessment; PsycINFO; shared decision making; systematic review; transitional care; Web of Science; advance care planning; aged; caregiver; factual database",Aged; Decision-making; Empowerment; Transitional care,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (812656)",This project received funding from the European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 812656. ,"L.
